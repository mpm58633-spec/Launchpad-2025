About Me
Hi, I’m Megha PM, a B.Tech student in Computer science and engineering at ACE College of Engineering, Trivandrum.
I’m passionate about coding and how it’s reshaping the world. I enjoy blending tech with real life — whether it’s vibe coding or exploring how it can be part of everyday experiences.
I’m a fast learner, always curious, and constantly looking for ways to level up my skills — web developmemt and app development
